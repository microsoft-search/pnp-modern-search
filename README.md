## "Sharing is Caring"

## "PnP Modern Search Office Hours"
If you are stuck on an issue or just need a peer review of your PnP Modern Search based idea, we have Office Hours.

You can sign up for a 15 min timeslot and a member of the community will set up a Teams call, where you can show and tell about the issue.
Office hours is every second Tuesday at mid afternoon UTC(0).
