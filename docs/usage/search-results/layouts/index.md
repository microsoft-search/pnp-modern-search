## Builtin layouts

By default, the following layouts are provided:

!["Available layouts"](../../../assets/webparts/search-results/layouts/available_layouts.png){: .center}

> Be careful, when you switch the layout in the property pane, all the previous layout properties are lost. We do this to avoid polluting the Web Part property bag with multiple useless configurations.

## Common settings

For all layouts, some common settings are available:

!["Common options"](../../../assets/webparts/search-results/layouts/common_options.png){: .center}

| Setting | Description | Default value 
| ------- |---------------- | ---------- |
| **Allow items selection** | If enabled, allow items to be selected in default layouts. See [documentation](../connections/item-selection.md) for usage. | Disabled.
| **Allow multiple selection** | If the item selection is allowed, specify if users can select multiple items | Disabled.
| **Hide this web part if there's nothing to show** | If there is no results, the Web Part will remain blank in display mode (title and 'See all' link included). In edit mode, you will see a message indicating there is no results. <p align="center">!["Common options"](../../../assets/webparts/search-results/layouts/hide_webpart.png)</p> | Disabled.
| **Show results count** | Hide or display the results count for the current query. | Enabled.
| **Use Microsoft Graph Toolkit** | Enable or disable the Microsoft Graph Toolkit to be used in Handlebars template. Refer to the [MGT documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/overview) to see available components.

### Result types

The result types feature gives you the ability to apply a conditional rendering at item level according to data source field values.

![Result Types](../../../assets/webparts/search-results/layouts/result_types_btn.png){: .center}

> Not all layouts support the result types feature (ex: Details lsit and slider layouts).

**Example**

Given the following conditions, we apply a border with a specific color for each: 

![Result Types](../../../assets/webparts/search-results/layouts/result_types.png){: .center}

![Result Types template](../../../assets/webparts/search-results/layouts/result_types_template.png){: .center}

The result would be like this:

![Result Types template](../../../assets/webparts/search-results/layouts/result_types_result.png){: .center}

The following operators are supported:

- Equals
- Not equals
- Contains
- StartsWith
- Greater Or Equal
- Less Or Equal
- Less than
- Greater than
- Is not null

In case you use a custom template, you can still benefit from this feature following this markup:

```html
{{#> resultTypes}}
  {{!-- The block below will be used as default item template if no result types matched --}}
  <div class="template_result">
      <!-- Your default template markup -->
  </div>
{{/resultTypes}}
```

Handlebars [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) are used behind the scenes and conditions are built dynamically using a recursive if/else structure.
