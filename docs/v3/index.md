# PnP Modern Search v3 #

!!! important "PnP Modern Search v3.x deprecation"
    **v4 uses a brand new code architecture and replace the older v3 codebase**. There will be no new features added to v3.x, but we will continue to
    provide bug fixes and minor changes as needed. As v4.x is not yet at feature parity with v3.x, you can still use the v3.x packages to meet your requirements.
    Also not that there is not an auto-upgrade path from v3 to v4 due to the new architecture, so you are perfectly ok
    to stay on the v3 version until v4 provides the features validating your upgrade.
    However, the main focus is on the v4 version, and new search functionality backed by the Microsoft Graph Search API will be v4 only.

    **v3 and v4 don't share the same package name, Web Part and solution IDs meaning you can have them side by side on a page if necessary without overlap.**

## What's included?

### Search Web Parts

SPFx solution `search-parts` including a complete set of SharePoint search Web Parts like a search results, search box, etc.

See [documentation](./search-parts/getting-started.md).

### Search extensibility library

A SPFx library component project `search-extensibility-library` allowing to create custom React components wrapped as web components to be included in the search results Web Part Handlebars templates when you require complex dynamic behavior at a granular component level.

See [documentation](./search-extensibility-library/getting-started.md).

### Search custom renderer

A SPFx application customizer project `search-custom-renderer` allowing to completly override the results display using an unique React component.

See [documentation](./search-custom-renderer/getting-started.md).

### Search query enhancer

A sample Azure function project `search-query-enhancer`to demonstrate the use of Microsoft LUIS and other cognitive services to interpret user intents and enhance the search box query accordingly.

See [documentation](./search-query-enhancer/getting-started.md).

## Applies to

* [SharePoint Framework](https:/dev.office.com/sharepoint)
* [Office 365 tenant](https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)

## Important notice on upgrading the solution from pre v2.2.0.0
**Due to code restructuring we have hit an edge case which impacts upgrades from previous versions. To solve the issue go to `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<appcatalog>/Lists/ComponentManifests` and remove the entries for SearchBox and Search Results, and then upload the .sppkg for the new release.**

**Next you need to loop over all sites which have the web parts installed, and upgrade the App on those sites. Now the web parts should work on new and existing sites. You may use the PnP command `Update-PnPApp` to update the application.**

**If you have deployed the solution as a tenant wide extension, this should not impact you.**

## Important notice on upgrading the solution from pre v3.0.0.0

**Because this version introduces a new standalone search filters Web Part, you will have to reconfigure all previous refiners from the search results Web Part to this new Web Part. You can get the previous layout for filters by selecting the 'Panel' layout in the new Web Part property pane.**
