# Scenarios

This section of the documentation provides some scenario-based recipes for building solutions with the PnP Modern Search Web Parts. It can be confusing to look across the documentation for ways to solve specific needs, so these scenarios may help. Wherever possible, we link back to the core documentation rather than explaining actions in duplicate.

## [Create a simple search page](create-simple-search-page.md)

We can create a search-driven experience simply by adding the PnP Modern Search Web Parts to a page: PnP Search Box and PnP Search Results.

## [Set up Managed Properties](set-up-managed-properties.md)

In order to use your custom column values as filters in your PnP Modern Search search solutions, those columns must be mapped to refinable manage properties and they must be mapped to Managed Properties.

## [Build a page with filters](page-with-filters.md)

Most search solutions require some filters (aka refiners) to allow the user to filter the initial results.

## [Create a search page with verticals (on different pages)](Create-a-search-page-with-verticals-on-different-pages.md)

Search verticals can be used to selectively search specific content per vertical. Using the SharePoint provider you can use result sources to limit the content returned, or you can add the required KQL in the web part itself. This sample shows how to set up multiple search verticals on different pages.

## [Scenario Create your first custom template](create-your-first-custom-template.md)

Create your first custom template

## [Store custom templates in SharePoint](howto-store-custom-templates-in-sharepoint.md)

Storing custom templates as files in a SharePoint site, is great when you want to use them across sites and want some control.

## [Edit custom templates in SharePoint](edit-custom-templates-in-sharepoint.md)

Storing custom templates as files in a SharePoint site, is great when you want to use them across sites and want some control.

## [Edit custom templates locally in Visual Studio Code](edit-templates-using-vscode-and-onedrive.md)

When you have your templates in SharePoint, it is easy to setup a way to edit locally on your computer and still get the result in SharePoint almost instantly.

## [Create a search page with verticals (within the same page)](Create-a-search-page-with-verticals-within-the-same-page.md)

Search verticals can be used to selectively search specific content per vertical. Using the SharePoint provider you can use result sources to limit the content returned,
or you can add the required KQL in the web part itself. This sample shows how to set up multiple search verticals on the same page.

## [Create a useful People Search](Create-a-useful-People-Search.md)
With the Modern Search Web Parts you can create a simple and useful People Search. You can search or filter people and you can show informations on the People Card when you hover.

## [Use query rules for promoted links](Use-query-rules-for-promoted-links.md)

With the Modern Search Web Parts you can show promoted links for important results. They will be configured with query rules in the SharePoint Search Admin Center. Promoted results will show users more informations and direct links about specific, predefined, terms they searching for.
