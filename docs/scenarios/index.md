# Scenarios

This section of the documentation provides some scenario-based recipes for building solutions with the PnP Modern Search Web Parts. It can vbe confusing to look across the documentation for ways to solve specific needs, so these scenarios may help. Wherever possible, we link back to the core documentation rather than explaining actions in duplicate.

## Scenario 1

[Create a simple search page](create-simple-search-page.md)

We can create a search-driven experience simply by adding the PmP Modern Search Web Parts to a page: PnP Search Box and PnP Search Results.

## Scenario 2

[Set up Managed Properties](set-up-managed-properties.md)

In order to use your custom column values as filters in your PnP Modern Search search solutions, those columns must be Site Columns (usually included in Content Types) and they must be mapped to Managed Properties.

## Scenario 3

[Build a page with filters](page-with-filters.md)

Most search solutions require some filters (aks refiners) to allow the user to filter the initial results.

## Scenario: Create your first custom template

[Scenario Create your first custom template](create-your-first-custom-template.md)
